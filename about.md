## Inspiration
I've been tossing this idea around in my head for a couple days and was finally inspired to build the blog by this tweet, so let's talk about why I'm not coding tonight.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Normalize having weeks where you aren‚Äôt trying to get a little bit better every day. Progress is great, but so is taking a break from striving for constant improvement.</p>&mdash; Kelly Vaughn üêû (@kvlly) <a href="https://twitter.com/kvlly/status/1395153003938725892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Who Am I?
I'm a Senior Engineering Manager at Hagerty managing the Billing & Payments and Money Platform teams. This blog is my own and does not necessarily reflect the thoughts and opinions of my employer.

I'm a full-stack developer with a history working in Ruby on Rails and PHP. I taught myself React and worked my way up into my current position of running 2 engineering teams through contributing and managing teams at multiple businesses working on complex apps at scale.
