<p>Got the models and hotwire mostly working. Added user authentication and scoped down editing and deleting resources to the owning user. App is a little buggy around one of the nested models but overall it does what I want it to do. Need to investigate a little more around the UI patterns in hotwire. There's some tricky complexity in the way the partials are rendered during a broadcast (ie without the global scope so you have no access to current_user) that will take some research to get right, but I was able to cheat it a little bit by just sending the user attached to the resources because my app is fairly simple and those resources can only be added, edited, or deleted by the owning user. But there's a lot to learn here.</p>
