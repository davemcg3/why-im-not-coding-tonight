<p>Apparently we never watched Transformers: Age of Extinction so we watched it last night. Seemed forced to try to be &quot;cool&quot; kind of like Hansel and Gretel. It seemed strange to hear Optimus Prime talk about wanting to kill a person and I don't understand why Transformers were cussing. It's origin was as a kids show and a lot of kids were obviously going to go watch the movie because the parents would have thought about it as a kid show. Movie overall was fine, kind of long, probably could have been edited shorter, but it was fine.</p>
