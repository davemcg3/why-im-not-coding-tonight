I'm working on functionality to build a markdown file from the results of a form submission n slack and send that to github as a markdown file, which should trigger a rebuild and deploy of this blog. Essentially this will allow me to add a new post without spinning up my IDE and adding a new markdown page and then committing it through github by automating all that process away!
