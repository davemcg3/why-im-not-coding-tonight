<!-- Excerpt End -->
<p>We had a long, hard day of moving again today. Neighbor came over and helped us unload our second (and final!) pod into the garage. Those are swept out and ready to be picked up on Tuesday. And then a couple friends came over and helped us move a lot of the things from the garage into the house. We opened up enough space to be able to get our little trailer into the garage too so now the HOA can't complain about it! I'm too tired to code today and I have to get up early tomorrow too to have the rental unit prepped for our move-out.</p>
