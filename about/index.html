<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>I've been tossing this idea around in my head for a couple days and was finally inspired to build the blog by this tweet, so let's talk about why I'm not coding tonight.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Normalize having weeks where you aren‚Äôt trying to get a little bit better every day. Progress is great, but so is taking a break from striving for constant improvement.</p>&mdash; Kelly Vaughn üêû (@kvlly) <a href="https://twitter.com/kvlly/status/1395153003938725892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<p>I'm an Engineering Manager at Beachbody working on the Beachbody OnDemand platform. This blog is my own and does not necessarily reflect the thoughts and opinions of my employer.</p>
<p>I'm a full-stack developer with a history working in Ruby on Rails and PHP. I taught myself React and worked my way up into my current position running an engineering team building a large, complex React app and integrating with multiple APIs to power a production website operating at scale.</p>
