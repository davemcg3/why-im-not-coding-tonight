I got a NAS for Christmas and I'm blown away how much I can do with it. Thinking about how I should configure it. Also watching Black Sails, which is a GREAT show and <em>exactly</em> what the Pirates of the Caribbean movies should have been! Pirates are so interesting that you don't need to introduce mystical elements to have a compelling and watchable story!
