I haven't posted on the blog in quite awhile because it's effort to turn on the computer and add a markdown file and commit it to github and push. I need something easier.

The plan is to build some sort of slack app that takes a message from a channel and posts it to an api, and the api then creates an appropriate markdown file and commits it to github for me.
