It's been a super long week with all the things I'm trying to accomplish and stay on top of. Even though I got my new Ant+ receiver and TFT SPI touchscreen and I'm dying to incorporate them into a new project I just don't have the energy to do the research and learn what I need to learn to make it happen. Maybe tomorrow.
