Wife was up for playing Ark tonight, totally unexpected! Got stuck building the taming raft but I think I found a setting to fix it, will check next time we play. Lost my dilos to a bronto while they were running down a moschops. Left my parasaur across the river while I went back to our tower to get ready to tame 2 raptors. It was nighttime so I was waiting for daylight and they snuck by and killed my parasaur across the river. üôÑ Daylight came and I hunted them down and tamed them, only died once in the process! Tamed 2 new Tek Parasaurs and 3 additional dilos and then took my pack hunting. They were running down another moschops and ended up attacking a Trike which attacked back so they killed it. Feeling pretty good about that. Raptors are 2 males so I still need to find a female so I can start breeding them. It was a good night.
