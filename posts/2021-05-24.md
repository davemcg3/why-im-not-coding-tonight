<!-- Excerpt Start -->
NOT CODING
<!-- Excerpt End -->

Tried to get my driver's license and truck registered in the new state, failed on both. Got my office minimally setup for work tomorrow, but still need to buy things for it, like a new chair. Got rid of mine at the last house because it wasn't worth the weight to move it (and an opportunity to buy a new chair!) so I have nothing to sit on right now. Buying stuff like that tonight instead of coding.
