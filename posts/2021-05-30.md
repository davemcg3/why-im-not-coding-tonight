<!-- Excerpt Start -->
NOT CODING
<!-- Excerpt End -->

Went to the zoo for my son's birthday this morning, relaxed some this afternoon, tonight played a few minutes of Battlefield Infinite Warfare (which I'm terrible at, apparently) then watched The New Mutants with my wife. Sometimes it's more important to just hang out than to code.
