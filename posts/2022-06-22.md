Apparently we never watched Transformers: Age of Extinction so we watched it last night. Seemed forced to try to be "cool" kind of like Hansel and Gretel. It seemed strange to hear Optimus Prime talk about wanting to kill a person and I don't understand why Transformers were cussing. It's origin was as a kids show and a lot of kids were obviously going to go watch the movie because the parents would have thought about it as a kid show. Movie overall was fine, kind of long, probably could have been edited shorter, but it was fine.
