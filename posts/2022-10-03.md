Working on building an Electron app to do tweet thread scheduling. I installed electron-forge and created a new webpack app with it, added nedb for persistent storage, added the react dependencies, and created the App.jsx file. I've also decided how I want to structure the database and what screens I'm going to need to build for the app.
