Ended up working on tests for an old project last night and continued them tonight. I have 2 separate projects that I'd like to merge so I can deploy one monorepo to my account on Heroku and get all the functionality in one spot, but I don't have good tests on one of the apps. I'm not confident to add the other functionality to that app without first getting a good test suite to make sure I don't break any existing functionality.

Spent way, way too much time tonight troubleshooting where a random failure was coming from. Turns out I had named a variable storing an image path with `_path` at the end and rspec, upon seeing me call that in a "fill_in" statement decided I was trying to load that url. Yikes. I found it, I fixed it, I'm tired and going to bed. But great success tonight.
