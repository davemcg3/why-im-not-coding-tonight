<!-- Excerpt Start -->
NOT CODING
<!-- Excerpt End -->

I'm feeling apathetic about my job right now and that's not a healthy way to approach work. Took the day off to recharge, plan on coding all day so I'm not going to feel like doing it tonight. Will be enrolling my daughter in school tonight and then hopefully playing more Ark.
