Finally got my github actions working! Now I just have to commit a new markdown file for the blog post and then github will run the eleventy branch and save the files to the appropriate branch so that it auto-deploys! Woot! This takes me one step closer to building a dynamic system where I don't actually have to commit to the repo directly to create a new post, which will free me up to make these posts from my phone!
